// All loops do the exact same thing (take bit of code and run it over and over and over again.
// "For" loops contain 3 pieces of information 1. Starting value 2. ending value 3. And how much you want to increment by

//  (in example above "x 5" would be starting point

    cout << x << endl; // Semi colon tells program to keep running.  So since loop and x is still less then 50 the program
// will run until x is incremented several more time until not less than 50.  Run program see what I'm talking about it is pretty cool.
