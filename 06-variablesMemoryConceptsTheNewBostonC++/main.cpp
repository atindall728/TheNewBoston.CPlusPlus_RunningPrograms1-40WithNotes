    int tuna = 99;  // when you declare what type of data you do not need write "int" for same variable

    tuna = 76; // So just "tuna" once you have defined it as "int tuna"
               // Variables are stored in memory and can be overwritten.Since computers read from top down.
               // Computer wipes from memory old value to make room for new value "tuna" in the case it is overwritten
    // Main point you don't need to write "int" each time when variable has been defined.

return 0;  // So for some reason my programs started running without cin.ignore().get();  ?  Not sure why since this still is not always the case.
           //  ?? Let me know if you find out.  Ah computers...  Silly slithery salamanders.
