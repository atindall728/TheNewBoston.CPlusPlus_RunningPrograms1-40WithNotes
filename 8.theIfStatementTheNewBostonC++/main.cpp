 //  It is EXTREMLY important that task are broken up into granular (small components)
            // Basically,  you should when you finish part of a program.  Run it.  See if it works.
            // Then add to it.  If there are bugs fix them as you go.  It will save you time in long run.
            // Many make mistake of building a large program then go to run it and it contains bugs that can only
            //  be found by going over all the code.  HUGE PAIN.  Save yourself the stress.  Don't do that (make massive
            // programs with code running everywhere)  Segment it out and treat each running portion as a separate piece of code.
