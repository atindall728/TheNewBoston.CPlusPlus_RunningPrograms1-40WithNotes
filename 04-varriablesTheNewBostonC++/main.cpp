#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Variables are an EXTREMELY important part of C++
// Put Simply a Variable is a place holder (int a "a" is the placeholder)  Waiting for a number.  Here
// we just give it a number.  In the future the user will input a number and the " a" (from int a) will be replaced by their input
//  In first example Bucky set int "tuna" as his variable and saw out "tuna" to screen.  Remember...

int main()

{
    int a = 4;  // So again like said above we went ahead and set this variable "a" to a number.  In this case
    int b = 21  // we created another variable "int b" where "be" is equal to 21

    int sum = a - b;  // Here we created a variable "sum" (from int sum)

    cout << sum;   // Now we can just type sum and the computer does the math and prints out to screen for us

    cin.ignore().get();

    return 0;

}


//"Int" is defined short for integer.  Meaning the computer expects the object to be an integer.  Will talk more about this later (int vs char vs float etc.)
